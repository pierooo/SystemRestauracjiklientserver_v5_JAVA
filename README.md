# SystemRestauracjiklientserver_v5_JAVA
Semester student project of Programming advanced JAVA applications course.

Login requirements:

Code: admin

Functionality:
The server part of the project deals with data models, i.e. receiving inquiries from
customers, processing, analyzing, creating and communicating with data files.
Thanks to the use of generic support for data models, we can add models without
interference with the functionality of the program. Thanks to the use of threads, it is possible
communication with the server by multiple clients. Client part creates (not yet complete)
user interface similar to the server part using generic service
objects, and communicates with the server part by sending queries and receiving answers.

Implementation:
- Classes of data models, communication, client / server system, sessions, windows, panels
-Inheritance: the entire system is based on generic support for object models
-Window interface in Swing (client part)
-Handling of exceptions
-Event handling
-ArrayList <>, HashMap <>
-Reading and writing from / to files (server part - KomunikacjaObiektyPliki class)
- Threads
-The client-server model
